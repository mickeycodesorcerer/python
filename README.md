# my-python-journey
I'm a <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/sinanata" target="_blank">growth hacker</a> with over 15 years of digital marketing experience and this is my python learning journey. I enjoy playing with HTML, CSS, JS, Python, PHP, SQL DBs. I am working on Exercism Python challenges here. Looking fwd to learn from my mistakes, your feedback is welcome if you have python experience.
